Leaving behind the only life she's ever known and entering the cynical world of men for the first time, torn between a mission to promote peace and her own warrior upbringing, as a 'Wonder Woman,' Diana must fight evil in a 'war to end all wars,' while hoping to unlock the potential of a humanity she doesn't always understand.",
